SQL JOINS
  - `INNER JOIN`
  - `LEFT JOIN`
  - `RIGHT JOIN`
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN`
--> Implementation of  various SQL join operations and also combined with aggregation FUNCTION using the
   `GROUP BY` clause to  query relational database  
--> focusing on retrieving meaningful insights from multiple related tables.
--> Performed **complex join operations** across multiple schemas to extract comprehensive and relational insights from structured datasets.
    Utilized:
  - `INNER JOIN` to fetch only matching records between tables.
  - `LEFT JOIN` to retrieve all records from the left table and matching ones from the right.
  - `RIGHT JOIN` to retrieve all records from the right table and matching ones from the left.
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN` to combine results from both tables, including unmatched rows from each.
